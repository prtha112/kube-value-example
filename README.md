# kube-value-example

## Description
This repository collects example `values.yaml` files and other configuration templates for deploying services using DevOps tools (e.g., Helm charts) on Kubernetes. The goal is to share real-world configuration values for different environments (dev, staging, production) to reduce research time and help DevOps teams or developers quickly adapt and deploy services.

## Purpose
- Reduce time spent researching suitable configuration values for each service
- Serve as a reference for DevOps/Developers when deploying new services
- Share best practices and proven configuration examples

## How to Use
1. Open the desired `values.yaml` file
2. Copy or adjust the configuration values to fit your environment
3. Use them with your Helm chart or deployment pipeline

## Notes
- All values are examples and can be customized as needed
- Contributions with more config examples are welcome via PR
